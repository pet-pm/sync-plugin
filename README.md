# Work in Progress

**Don't use yet, this is a work in progress.**

Documentation will be added once the plugin is complete. The same goes for much functionality.

This plugin is based on the `UnreleasedSyncPlugin.plugin.js` snippet I made as a proof of concept. The goal is to provide a way to sync BetterDiscord plugins across devices using a self-hosted or third-party backend.

The current plan is to offer free hosting up to a predetermined amount of plugins (and themes in the future) and anything above that will be a subscription model for maybe 2 euros a month.

Thank you for your patience.
